 About Me
</h2>
<div>
As a tech enthusiast, I decided to pursue a life as a software developer through self-teaching and eventually a coding bootcamp App Academy. Throughout my time there, not only did I learn many technologies (JavaScript, Python, PostgreSQL, Express.js, etc.); I dramatically increased my ability to learn, collaborate with a team, and most importantly: love what I do (coding). Since that period, I have worked in professional environments and strengthened my skills through additional studies and paid projects. My current focus is blockchain technologies, specifically in the superior language, Rust ðŸ¦€!

Now for the part that probably seems like an online dating profile:
When I'm not working with code, I can often be found studying finance, hardware, blockchain technologies, or (hopefully this part does not prematurely end our relationship) watching my Kansas City Chiefs dominate on the football field.

If you are reading this and share the same interests, maybe we can collaborate sometime and share knowledge. I am always down to collaborate and learn something new!
